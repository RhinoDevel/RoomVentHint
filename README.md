# RoomVentHint

Gives you a hint, if ventilating the air in a room (e.g. by opening the windows)
currently makes sense, based on momentary temperatures and relative humidities
measured inside and outside the room.

The rule of thumb is to open the windows when the temperature outside is the
same or lower than inside, only, to avoid increasing the humidity inside.

The calculations made here make ventilation possible under some circumstances,
even if it is warmer outside than inside without increasing humidity!

The math used is based on [this blog post](https://carnotcycle.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/how-to-convert-relative-humidity-to-absolute-humidity/)
by Peter Mander.
